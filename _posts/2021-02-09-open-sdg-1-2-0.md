Open SDG is an open-source reporting platform for managing and publishing statistics related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is freely available for any country or organization to reuse and can be hosted and maintained using free services.

Last month, the Open SDG community launched version 1.2.0, marking a significant milestone in the Open SDG journey. Version 1.2.0 includes a number of accessibility improvements, design upgrades, and notable new features.

More is in the works, with version 1.3.0 due to release early Spring 2021. Weâ€™re also developing a series of training videos to help people develop and maintain their Open SDG platforms.

The main focus in this release was accessibility. We have added full keyboard-navigation to all pages, and a comprehensive revamp of the support for screen-readers. This ensures that all users will be able to find the same information.

Other notable updates include these optional features:

* graph annotations
* disaggregation tab on reporting status page
* custom title/description on reporting status page
* custom title/description on goals list
* language toggle as links (instead of dropdown)
* language toggle in footer menu
* custom descriptions for individual goal pages
* source file download buttons

You can view a summary of the updates on our [platform updates page](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/updates/), and a more detailed list in our [1.2.0 release notes](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg/releases/tag/1.2.0).

There are 12 countries/cities/regions already using Open SDG, and 10 more implementations are under development. Do you want to join them?
